My daughter, Evalyn, turned 2 this week so I thought it only right to create her a ramen dish with some of her favourite ingredients... but don't worry, I'm not going to create some sort of crazy chocolate and milk flavoured ramen!  Saying that, maybe chocolate ramen should be my recipe for next week considering it's Valentine's Day. Is a chocolate noodle an aphrodisiac? I guess this post sums it up (http://www.eater.com/2016/1/29/10871876/chocolate-ramen-japan) but feel free to add your views in the comments. Anyway, I digress, back to my daughter's favourite (savoury) foods and the main ingredients for this ramen: salmon and egg.

As you can probably imagine, I'm not the kind of guy to pander to the idea that babies need baby food, I'm also not the kind of guy that believes there should be a kids menu at a restaurant that only serves pizza, burger and chips, or chicken nuggets! Why are kids fobbed off with naff food when the adults get to eat the full a la carte menu? Surely this is breeding a culture of bad eaters! So at home Evalyn gets to eat what we eat, sans sel. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't but this is less because she doesn't like the food and more because she likes to test the boundaries of our sanity!  Anyway, this post is dedicated to Evalyn's birthday ramen... I hope she likes it!!

**It's All About That Base**

There are traditionally four types of broths: shoyo, which is a soy based broth; shio, which is a salt based broth; tonkotsu, which is a pork bone based broth; and miso, which is a beancurd based broth. This infographic sums up the styles perfectly.

Last week I made a shoyo broth and it was delicious, so this week I wanted to pick a different broth type, but it had to be one that would work with salmon and egg. My choice was a miso based broth. There are a few types of miso, which i will explain in another post, but for this meal I thought a light shiro miso (white miso) would be best as it is slightly sweet and lighter than the others. This would allow for the salmon flavour to shine through as the broth wouldn't be too heavy. In Japan this type of light broth is known as _assari_.

![106977](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/106977.jpg)** Hanging in the Balance**

In the previous post I mentioned that the Japanese have this idea of the power of five to balance a meal. Therefore, I now needed to look at what was missing from my dish to balance it out. First up are the five tastes: I already had sweet from the miso, and umami from the egg, salmon, miso and noodles, therefore I needed to find a way to incorporate bitter, sour and salty into the dish. Next up are the five colours: I already had white from the egg and orange from the salmon so i needed three more colours. Finally I needed five cooking styles: I already had grilling for the salmon and boiling (or cooking in the sous-vide) for the egg, so I needed 3 more cooking styles. Ultimately this is a lot to think about and I have only touched on the power of five here. There is also the 5 sounds as well as the 5 attitudes but these are more abstract and difficult to master so, as much as I'd want to build the perfect dining experience for my daughter on her 2nd birthday, she'll have to make do with 3 our of the 5 senses being fulfilled!

So I added some raw watercress to the meal, which allowed me to add a new colour (green), a new cooking style (raw) and a new taste (bitter) - what a great addition! I then added pickled cucumber, which gave me a new taste (sour) as well as a new cooking method (pickling). I also added beansprouts, fried in garlic and ginger, to add a new cooking method (frying). Finally, I decided to grill the salmon skin-side up so that it crisped up and went slightly brown, which added a couple of new colours  (brown and black). Finally I realised I needed a salt taste so figured this could come from the broth and so I added a pork stock. I've enjoyed creating this recipe as it's allowed me to think of the complexities of the dish, come up with a solution to (most of) the problems and then present them in a way that is pleasing and inviting. Well... Happy Birthday Evalyn!

**Ingredients (serves 2)**

_The broth:_



* 1l pork stock
* 1 tsp instant dashi stock
* 2 tbsp shiro miso
* 1 tsp light soy sauce

_The toppings:_





* 2 eggs
* 2 fillets of salmon
* Handful of bean sprouts
* 1/2 clove garlic
* 1cm piece of ginger
* Splash of sesame oil
* Watercress

_The pickled cucumber:_





* 1 cucumber
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 tsp salt
* 60g rice vinegar

The noodles:





* 2 Medium egg noodles

**Method**





1. At least 2 days before cut the cucumber into thin slices and place in a bowl with the salt, give it a good shake to cover all pieces. Leave for 5 minutes and then wash the salt off. Add the cucumber to a sealed container with the sugar and rice wine vinegar and store in the fridge.
2. Heat the sous-vide to 65C and place the eggs in for 45 minutes. When they are done plunge into an ice bath for 5 minutes.
3. Make the miso broth and leave to simmer.
4. Brush the salmon with sesame oil and grill skin side up for 5 minutes.
5. Boil the noodles and divide between bowls.
6. Place cucumber on noodles near the lower end of the bowl.
7. Scatter watercress on one half of the noodles and then place salmon skin side up on top.
8. Fry the ginger and garlic in sesame oil then quickly toss the bean sprouts in them, drain and place on the othe side of the bowl, on the noodles. Place the egg, whole, on the bean sprouts.
9. Pour over the stock and serve with nanami togarashi.



**The Verdict**



A resounding success! I was well chuffed with this recipe because it gave me an opportunity to explore the possibilities with ramen whilst also coming up with something that my daughter would like to eat at the grand old age of 2\. However, the thing that I was most proud of today was how Evalyn learnt the true Japanese way eat ramen (and she even has a top knot!)...
