Welcome to the first installment of my Pizza Diaries!

## What to expect

Pizza mainly.

But... this is a place for me to experiment with making my own pizza dough. A place where I can write down my thoughts on a specific recipe I have tried or creat`  ed. But mostly a place where I can tweak the recipes with the ultimate goal of crafting the perfect pizza every time I make it. 

So, that means you can expect the posts to contain information on the recipes, tweaks, toppings, temperature, proofing, etc. - all the things that make pizza so good. Do I want my pizza dough and method of cooking to become a Hallmark of fine pizza crafting standards for future generations? Hell yes! Will it? Probably not, but I can dream, and if I can't reach those lofty heights, I will at least have eaten a lot of good (and bad) pizza on the way. And that is absolutely fine by me.

## Why am I doing this? 

I've always enjoyed cooking outside. Whether it be roasting a chicken on a charcoal BBQ in my garden for my family; cooking a top-notch fry-up on a tiny barrel BBQ whilst on a camping trip with my wife; or (over)cooking a hunk of beef in a fire pit I'd dug out with some friends in a remote part of Sweden; there is just something exciting about being in the open air and cooking on real fire. Something primal maybe? 

So a few years back my in-laws had a place in Ostuni, Italy, which just so happened to have a proper forno out the back. Obviously I wasn't going to let this forno sit there wasting space, so I got to work building up a fire to warm the very core of it's solid stone heart. And once I had got it to what I thought was the correct temperature, I threw a pizza that I had made on to it and it cooked withen around 90 seconds flat! It was a wonderful experience and I would do it again in a heartbeat, unfortunately the house has been sold, which leaves me with only one option, figure out a way to recreate that experience at home.

And this is where the story begins...
