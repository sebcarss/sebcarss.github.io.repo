Yay! Ramen day!

So this week I was going to do a Valentine's day special, as last week I did a special treat for my daughter, but then I realised it's a bit late, aphrodisiac foods are weird, and somehow having an oyster on a ramen dish didn't seem appropriate... the moment has indeed passed. So this week I will continue my quest into the different styles of broths that are present in the majority of ramen dishes and learn a bit more about the wonderful history of this mystical soup. This week is _Shio_!

Shio (pronounced she-oh) is Japanese for salt (i bet you didn't guess that, did you?), and it is the oldest form of ramen seasoning (ooh another surprise, you spoil us!). Ok, what about this one... did you know that the word _salary_ comes from the word _sal_, which means Salt in Latin?

Ok, ok, I'll stick to the topic at hand... ramen!

By all accounts a shio broth is going to be saltier than the other broths as that is the main seasoning, it probably isn't one to have every day, in fact, having it just once is probably well above the recommended daily allowance of salt intake, so if you are trying this at home, use caution please, as I don't think salt was considered bad back when ramen was first invented. Some of the recipes that I found on my travels called for an unprecedented amount of salt, one recipe expected 2 tablespoons of salt for 4 people, which even if it didn't cause a heart attack would surely leave you gasping for water for the rest of the evening!

There are two parts to the ramen broth: the first is the soup, which is usually made from some bones that have been boiled into a stock along with the traditional dashi stock - a stock made by gently boiling kombu (seaweed) and katsuobushi (dried bonito fish); and the second is the _tare_, which is the seasoning that gives the stock it's main flavour. For this ramen I will be using a couple of chicken stock cubes and some instant dashi, which makes it very easy to make on a weeknight with a two year old attached to my leg. The tare will consist of sake, a Japanese rice wine; mirin, a sweet Japanese cooking wine; sugar and a tiny bit of soy sauce. If you are bold you could add more salt but the stock cube has enough already for my taste.

Some of you lovely readers may have realised that I'm not putting my all into this ramen broth, I've been using pork stock and instant dashi without once thinking about making the stocks myself. This will be blasphemy to some people, like asking a waiter at a French restaurant if you can have your steak well done... it's not the done thing. Supposedly there are even Japanese ramen chefs who don't allow takeaway ramen, as the noodles will overcook in the broth by the time they eat it and it will ruin the dish. There is even a recommended time limit to eat your noodles by, 5 minutes, if you take any longer, then it is recommended that you split the noodles into two parts, where they bring the second half of the noodles to you after some time has passed, ensuring that the noodles are cooked to perfection throughout your meal. These are the kinds of folks that would turn their nose up at my attempt at ramen, and who am I to argue? What I will say is that this is only the beginning and I will be making my very own broths as soon as I've understood the way of the ramen. Just think of me a little like this guy at the beginning of the first movie and you'll get where I'm coming from:

As the broth is so simple to make I wanted to try something more interesting for the topping so I decided to follow the lead of that David Chang fella, of Momofuku restaurant fame, and add some pulled pork to the dish. For this I decided to pull out the pressure cooker, as this is a great way to make pulled pork in only 30 minutes.

Another ingredient I like to use is the egg... oh the wonderful egg! Those of you that have been paying close attention to the recipes so far may have noticed that I have a sous-vide, that wonderful invention that allows you to control the temperature of your food more precisely because water transfers heat better than air (for more information on this wonderful cooking technique check out this post from a previous Chief Technical Officer of Microsoft, Nathan Myrvold [Why cook sous vide?](http://modernistcuisine.com/2013/01/why-cook-sous-vide/)). I've been using it to cook my eggs to the perfect temperature so that the egg doesn't overcook. However, I don't know what the perfect temperature is for ramen, so I've been experimenting. My first egg was cooked for 45 minutes at 63C, which made a very runny egg that almost became part of the broth; my second attempt was cooked for 45 minutes at 65C, which meant the yolk was soft but not runny, unfortunately the egg wasn't the freshest so the white hadn't completely set yet; and for this attempt I will be cooking the egg for 22 minutes at 70C, which will hopefully mean a hard white and a soft but not runny yolk. Fingers crossed!

**Pressure-Cooked Pork Ramen with a Shio Broth**

![IMG_4011](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_4011.jpg?w=768)





**Ingredients**



_The pressure-cooked pork:_

* 1kg pork shoulder, cut into 3cm cubes
* 500g pork stock

_The broth:_

* 2 chicken stock cubes (containing ~5g salt each)
* 1 tsp instant dashi

_The tare:_

* 2 tbsp sake
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 2tsp sesame oil
* 1/4 tsp soy sauce

_The toppings:_

* 2 eggs
* 1 lg carrot, sliced into thin rounds
* a handful of watercress

_The noodles:_

* 2 slabs of medium egg noodles

**Method**

1. If you are using a sous-vide then bring it up to 70C before you start as this can take a while. If not, you can boil your egg later, before serving.
2. Put the pork stock and the pork shoulder in the pressure cooker, lock the lid on and bring to full pressure (15 psi) then time it for 30 mins. If you start to smell roasting flavours then the stock has probably boiled off and you are starting to get some maillard reaction, which means caramelisation of the meat, this will add some great depth of flavour but if cooked any longer it may burn. When cooled take out the meat and shred with two forks.
3. In the meantime, add the eggs to the sous-vide and cook for 22 minutes. When cooked take out and cool in an ice bath, peel and place on the noodles.
4. Combine the ingredients for the broth with 1 litre of hot water, in a pan. Add the tare ingredients and bring to a boil, then turn down to low to keep warm.
5. Cook the carrots in boiling water for about 7 minutes, and when cooked place on the noodles.
6. Cook the noodles and add to the bowls, then top with ingredients, mentioned above as well as the watercress, and then pour over the broth.

This recipe was delicious! Strangely I felt it could have done with some extra salt but I think that was because I was expecting it to be really salty and actually it was just the right amount. The pork worked really well and using a pressure cooker was so simple, if you haven't got one I recommend it as it speeds up midweek cooking of tough meats to just 30 mins. The egg wasn't as great as I imagined it to be, it was pretty much the same as the 65C egg that was cooked for 45 mins. It tasted lovely but the white wasn't as set as I had wished, I think I need to buy fresher eggs! Finally, although the carrots and watercress helped balance out the meal, I felt it was missing something to cut through the fat of the pork, luckily I still has some of the pickled cucumbers from a previous recipe so added some of those afterwards and that complimented the dish really well.
